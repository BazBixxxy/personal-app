      "One pattern I keep noticing is politicians making grand promises: High-speed trains run every 30 minutes without delays. While the tracks are a century old and shared by freight, regional, and high-speed trains. Ordinary people hear this stuff and laugh. They know it's not going to happen anytime soon...",

    content:
      "Software developers stare at sprawling, messy codebases nobody fully understands. They hunt down bugs, fix them, and move on to the next feature. Nothing flashy. But after years of incremental problem-solving, the product becomes solid, stable, and surprisingly potent...",
