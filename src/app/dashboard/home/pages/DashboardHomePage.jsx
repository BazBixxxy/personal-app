      "One pattern I keep noticing is politicians making grand promises: High-speed trains run every 30 minutes without delays. While the tracks are a century old and shared by freight, regional, and high-speed trains. Ordinary people hear this stuff and laugh. They know it's not going to happen anytime soon...",
